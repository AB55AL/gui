linux mach-test: pulling corner of GUI Demo window around lags

crash on clicking the top-left corner x to exit

mach-test: top-left corner X icon is bad?
podcast: missing icon in episode description? 

mach-test: no tab key?

go through changes in https://github.com/david-vanderson/gui/pull/3

clicking on podcast in middle from separate application (to focus it), leaves the mouse pointer in the wrong state (it thinks it's not on top of the floating window)

try splitting into 2 files - widgets.zig and gui.zig (which re-exports widgets)

zig build how do I not build mach stuff when only doing sdl stuff?

do all of the suggestions from Mike
- screenshots in README
- links to example code in README for each section

write up some design docs
- tabindex
- seamless animations

start making real demo() contents
- document stuff inside there?
- following dear imgui demo
 - Basic Widgets
  - radio
  - slider
  - hold-repeat buttons
  - tooltips
  - dropdown selection
- mouse cursors
- gravity
- themes

problem of mousing off a menuItem and onto the theme change checkbox, and the menuItem stays highlighted
- when a mouse motion event in a Menu happens:
  - if "towards" an open submenu:
    - Menu eats the event and nothing else happens
  - otherwise it's passed to children:
      - if it's on a MenuItem, focus it
      - if not, and the MenuItem is focused, defocus it
  - but that means that as you mouse off the edge, when the mouse goes into the margin, it will defocus the menu item?
  - have to implement intention-motion MenuItem (de)activation to fix this


switch mouse button events to use separate button and action

define events like mach does it
- only key and text events need the window focus stuff

test what happens if std.time.nanoTimestamp() jumps backwards or forwards
- if backwards just a tiny bit, stay on frame_time_ns?
- if backwards more (or forwards a lot), reset frame_time_ns and also shift any animations?
- check begin() and beginWait()


text input support in mach
clipboard support in mach

maybe adjust renderText to snap text to pixel grid?

xstart and ystart for textSize

kerning
- check how sdl_ttf does it

popup needs to align it's text with the label that popped it
- take a flag for whether it's popping updown or sideways, then adjust x or y to account for border and padding

switch to adwaita default font?

mach: do clipping in the shader?

should popups and floating windows inherit the scale of their parents?

maybe parameterize gui based on given Vertex type?

premultiplied alpha for all textures (and vertices from PathStroke/Fill?)
- also font glyphs

when we have a widget that has captured the mouse, need to capture the mouse in the underlying window system so click-dragging works even when the mouse pointer goes outside the window

try animating a fade
- does Options need a separate alpha?

punchlist for podcast app:
- equal-sized weight option to boxlayout
- bitmaps
- textentry needs to be able to paste a url

some visual indication of non-focused windows
- maybe change focus color inside?

debugging:
- highlight widgets that are causing cueFrames?
- show layout somehow (mouseover?)
- maybe just a separate floating window that shows a tree-view of all the widgets
  - mouseover to highlight the widget?

textlayout:
- minSizeForChild should recalc based on the four corners

split gravity into 2 0-1 values plus a text baseline?

hover and highlight properties need to propogate down to children so that icons can draw properly in buttons where the button is highlighted but not the icon directly?
  - maybe as part of the Options struct?


PathStroking with thickness
- endcaps?
- need to adjust points if they are too close together or angle is too acute
  - on acute angle side and do line intersection
    - so we have points a,b,c where b is the current intersection point above p
    - if the angle from p to a is on the wrong side of b, then project a onto the line from p to b to ensure convexness
  - on other side, do line intersection
    - but set some maximum on the length of the point from p


dialog
- maybe a flag on floatingwindow?
- have a separate function that does the nextWindowCleanup
  - always call in deinit, but also user can call that and get result if the user pressed esc
  - are there other things a user could press?
- rss textentry should bubble up the enter that it doesn't process so the dialog can record that it should "submit"

popups need to have a scrollarea
- scrollarea needs to not show the scrollbar if no need
- also main window and floating windows
- probably default layouts for those should be a vertical scrollarea with showing the scrollbar only when needed (and when not showing it don't scroll past the beginning or end)

maybe use stb_truetype or whatever so we don't need sdl_ttf?
- translate-c is failing for a few of the functions

change cursorlayout from top-to-bottom to left-to-right with optional extra floating widgets that get routed around
- save info for each line
  - size and baseline offset
  - height is max of (height of items without baseline) and max of (max of baselines, max of underhangs) of items with baselines
  - if new size/baseline is different, cueFrame()
- replace menubar horizontal box with textlayout so that lots of menus will wrap

baseline alignment
- maybe only inside TextLayout?
- vertical alignment needs additional .baseline
- rectFor provides baseline float offset from top of rect
- minSize needs to send baseline offset
- PlaceIn honors .baseline alignment

make Alt do special stuff with the menubar

need to free widgets that are allocated on the arena
- like TextWidget does it

scroll widget when stuff is being added/deleted
- lock to top if there previously
- scroll to bottom if there previously
- otherwise scroll to widget that was in the middle?
