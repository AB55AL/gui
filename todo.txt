text still looks cutoff at the bottom in gui-test

IconTexture shouldn't have to copy all the pixels just to change the type passed to textureCreate

integration points:
!- texture
!- renderGeometry
- initialization
!- cursors
!- clipping
- pollevent/waiteventtimeout
!- keysym and mods
- colors
- clipboard text


@import gui

win = gui.Window.init(gpa, ???)

loop:
make arena
win.begin(arena, logical_size, pixel_size)
- add events
win.endEvents();
- gui code
us = win.end();
set_cursor(win.cursor);
- present view
win.wait(max_fps);

when "Podcast 1" is highlighted, then we get a weird artifact on top of "back" above episodes
- sdl only?  Scale 1.0

maybe adjust renderText to snap text to pixel grid?

xstart and ystart for textSize

kerning
- check how sdl_ttf does it

DataSet/Get should use widget id and name like Animations

should popups and floating windows inherit the scale of their parents?

SDL: setting cliprect on every renderGeometry call is slow

PanedWidget should do it's mouse events after children
- otherwise it's hard to grab a scroll grab just to the side of the sash

Window needs a deinit
- deinit caches, cursors, backend

maybe parameterize gui based on given Vertex type?

premultiplied alpha for all textures (and vertices from PathStroke/Fill?)
- also font glyphs

sometimes the scrollbar handle gets a 1-pixel line in the middle partway through?
- are the rounded corner verticies overlapping?

cursor stuff needs to differentiate between owning the whole gui and doing extra gui stuff on top
- if the last mouse point is over the gui OR the gui has captured the mouse
  - then the gui sets the cursor (or sets it to arrow if it was set last frame)
- otherwise gui doesn't want to set the cursor

convert:
- ScrollBar
- ScaleWidget

floating windows should have a close button

try animating a fade
- does Options need a separate alpha?

punchlist for podcast app:
- equal-sized weight option to boxlayout
- arbitrarily long scroll?
- bitmaps
- textentry needs to be able to paste a url

some visual indication of non-focused windows
- maybe change focus color inside?

debugging:
- highlight widgets that are causing CueFrames?
- show layout somehow (mouseover?)
- maybe just a separate floating window that shows a tree-view of all the widgets
  - mouseover to highlight the widget?

copy other widgets from imgui

textlayout:
- minSizeForChild should recalc based on the four corners

options should have an explicit "rect" thing where the child doesn't ask the parent for a rect and doesn't report it's size, it just draws at that location (from the parent's screenRectScale), it's out of the normal flow

split gravity into 2 0-1 values plus a text baseline?

hover and highlight properties need to propogate down to children so that icons can draw properly in buttons where the button is highlighted but not the icon directly?
  - maybe as part of the Options struct?


PathStroking with thickness
- endcaps?
- need to adjust points if they are too close together or angle is too acute
  - on acute angle side and do line intersection
    - so we have points a,b,c where b is the current intersection point above p
    - if the angle from p to a is on the wrong side of b, then project a onto the line from p to b to ensure convexness
  - on other side, do line intersection
    - but set some maximum on the length of the point from p


dialog
- maybe a flag on floatingwindow?
- have a separate function that does the nextWindowCleanup
  - always call in deinit, but also user can call that and get result if the user pressed esc
  - are there other things a user could press?
- rss textentry should bubble up the enter that it doesn't process so the dialog can record that it should "submit"

stacking order of child windows?
- each window's children are on top of their parent?
  - but the stacking order of the children can be altered
- window.floating_windows
  - during a frame it only has windows that are ancestors of the current window
  - at the end when we finally pop the render queue it will reget all windows in stacking order
- windows persist a stacking list of children (along with positions in renderqueue)
  - init
    - child window records start in parent's deferredrenderqueue
    - child does FloatingWindowAdd
  - deinit
    - child window records end in parent's deferredrenderqueue
    - child pops itself from window.floating_windows
  - deferredrenderpop does it in stacking order and re-adds FloatingWindowData

popups need to have a scrollarea
- scrollarea needs to not show the scrollbar if no need
- also main window and floating windows
- probably default layouts for those should be a vertical scrollarea with showing the scrollbar only when needed (and when not showing it don't scroll past the beginning or end)

maybe use stb_truetype or whatever so we don't need sdl_ttf?
- translate-c is failing for a few of the functions

popups need to bubble up tab event so that the root menu can decide what to do with it
- File/Edit menu moves to next item_prev
- all other menus do nothing

menu/submenu keyboard nav

change cursorlayout from top-to-bottom to left-to-right with optional extra floating widgets that get routed around
- save info for each line
  - size and baseline offset
  - height is max of (height of items without baseline) and max of (max of baselines, max of underhangs) of items with baselines
  - if new size/baseline is different, CueFrame()
- replace menubar horizontal box with textlayout so that lots of menus will wrap

baseline alignment
- maybe only inside TextLayout?
- vertical alignment needs additional .baseline
- rectFor provides baseline float offset from top of rect
- minSize needs to send baseline offset
- PlaceIn honors .baseline alignment

make Alt do special stuff with the menubar

scroll area scroll to newly-focused widget?
- bubble a special "show this screen rect" event
- how to tell if a widget is just receiving focus instead of having it from last frame?

forms where you can press "enter" in a form field and it clicks the ok button
- also "esc" clicks the cancel button
- maybe a FormWidget that wraps those
  - bubbleEvent can catch "enter" from text entry
  - FormEvent() call for user side to use on button press that creates and bubbles an event?


ability to use gui floating windows alongside a game
- addEvent should return whether gui wants the event or not

need to free widgets that are allocated on the arena
- like TextWidget does it


scroll widget when stuff is being added/deleted
- lock to top if there previously
- scroll to bottom if there previously
- otherwise scroll to widget that was in the middle?


flag whether the app should show the mouse cursor
